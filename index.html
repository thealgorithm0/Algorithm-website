          <h2>Community Definition</h2>
          <p>
            The Algorithm, a student-founded and student-led tech community at
            Padma Kanya Campus, is dedicated to leveraging technology for the
            betterment of society and gender equality. Representation of females
            in STEM is very low, primarily due to a lack of instilled
            confidence, access to learning STEM concepts, role models, and more.
            One common sentiment among the females in my university is that we
            are limiting ourselves due to a lack of confidence and imposter
            syndrome. Therefore, The Algorithm community focuses on helping
            females build confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Senior year university students organize workshops and events for
            junior year students. As the junior students gain knowledge, the
            senior students, serving as organizers or mentors, also gain
            confidence by exposing themselves to leadership roles. In the past
            10 months, our community has expanded beyond its initial scope.
            Initially, we had 8 executive members, but now we have added 3 more
            to our board. Additionally, we have positively impacted over 500
            women through our events, workshops, and projects. We have expanded
            our reach by collaborating with prominent organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our significant milestones is being included in the Women in
            Data Steering Committee by The Asia Foundation, where we work on
            dismantling systemic barriers and fostering a more equitable future
            for women in the data and technology landscape. Currently, we are
            focusing on open data and how it can be leveraged to make
            data-driven policies. To this end, we are organizing hackathons
            outside the capital city, focusing on these themes. Together, we
            pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive tomorrow.

              <strong>Lack of Confidence and Imposter Syndrome:</strong> Many of
              us struggle with self-doubt and imposter syndrome, which can limit
              our potential.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Desire for Leadership Skills:</strong> We seek
              opportunities to practice and develop our leadership skills.

              <strong>Volunteering Experience:</strong> Gaining volunteering
              experience is important to us, as it helps in securing internships
              and building our resumes.
            </li>

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Our community's mission is to build an ecosystem within the campus
            where everyone feels welcome to practice their leadership skills.
            The heart of our community is that senior year students organize
            workshops for junior year students. This approach allows senior
            students to lead events, boosting their confidence, while junior
            students benefit from the knowledge and experience of their seniors.
            An additional benefit for senior year students is that these
            leadership experiences enhance their resumes, making it easier to
            secure internships.
